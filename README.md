# vrp_greedy
Sample VRP problem with Greedy solution

# Preconditions
Before run the example, you must to create a folder 'results' inside the project folder; that folder will be the place to put the result from the test that the algorithm make.

# Datasets
The datasets are inside the folder db in the file tests.csv. If you want to use an other datasets, only replace de value from the filename at line 5 in main_greedy.m.

# Files
In file main_greedy.m are all the main code to execute the test. The others files are functions that we need like dist.m (used to calculate the euclidean distance between all points) and simple_o_function.m (used to gets the fitness of the chromosomes).
